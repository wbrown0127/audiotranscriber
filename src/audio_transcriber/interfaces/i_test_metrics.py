# Interface for test metrics collection and analysis
"""
System Architecture Notes
------------------------

Core Flow:
Main -> Application Coordinator (implements Resource, State, Monitoring Manager interfaces)

Coordinators:
Application Coordinator controls:
Monitoring -> system monitoring
Component -> audio processing
Cleanup -> resource cleanup
Testing -> test framework

Resources:
Resource Pool manages:
Buffer, Storage, Thread Pool (each implements interface)

Audio Chain:
Audio Capture (uses WASAPI) -> Signal Processor -> Speaker Isolation -> Whisper Transcriber
Each implements respective interface

Support:
Alert System -> System Verifier -> Windows Manager
Recovery Logger tracks verification
All use interfaces

Interface:
Main Window connects:
Application Coordinator
Status Display
Control Panel
Audio Visualizer

Testing:
Testing Coordinator manages:
Test Environment
Test Data Manager
Test Metrics
All implement interfaces

System Flow:
Monitoring tracks Resource Pool
Component manages Audio Chain
Cleanup handles resources
Component controls State Machine

Error Flow:
Monitoring, Alert System -> Recovery Logger

Test Coverage:
Testing Coordinator validates:
Component, Monitoring, Cleanup, State Machine

Note: Interface-based communication throughout system
