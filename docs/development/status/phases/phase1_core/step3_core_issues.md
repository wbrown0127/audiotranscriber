# Core Architectural Issues Analysis

## 1. State Management Issues
- Component states spread across multiple coordinators
- Complex state transition validation
- No clear ownership of state management
- State change notifications tightly coupled
- StateMachine has direct dependencies on coordinators
- Recovery states tightly coupled with buffer management
- Channel-specific states increase complexity
- Resource validation mixed with state transitions
- Test states not properly integrated with component states
- Async state transitions not fully handled
- State rollback during test failures needs coordination
- Lock acquisition order during state transitions not verified

## 2. Resource Management Issues
- Mixed responsibilities between coordinators
- Complex allocation/deallocation paths
- Resource tracking spread across components
- No centralized resource lifecycle
- Test resource cleanup not properly integrated
- Memory pool fragmentation during long test runs
- Resource limits not enforced across test boundaries
- Temporary test file management not standardized
- Resource leak detection needs improvement

## 3. Error Handling Issues
- Error propagation paths unclear
- Recovery procedures span multiple coordinators
- Complex error state management
- Inconsistent error reporting
- Test failures not properly distinguished from system errors
- Error context loss during async operations
- Recovery procedures not verified in test scenarios
- Error injection mechanisms not standardized
- Thread failure handling incomplete

## 4. Testing Challenges
- Components must be tested with real system interactions
- No mocking allowed (except Whisper API during development)
- Circular dependencies require real component instantiation
- State verification must use actual state changes
- Hardware dependencies require real device testing
- Test environment setup/teardown not atomic
- Resource cleanup between tests unreliable
- Test isolation not guaranteed
- Performance impact of real device tests
- Test data generation not standardized
- Hardware test lab requirements not specified
- Long-running test stability issues
- Test result aggregation incomplete

## 5. Async Operation Issues
- No explicit examples of async error propagation in lock hierarchy
- Missing guidance for async state transitions during test execution
- Need examples of async resource cleanup coordination
- Lack of async operation timeout handling in test scenarios
- Async error context preservation incomplete
- No standardized async operation patterns
- Missing async operation cancellation handling
- Incomplete async resource lifecycle management

## 6. Hardware Resource Issues
- No detailed examples of hardware resource cleanup in TestingCoordinator
- Missing specifications for hardware test lab requirements
- Incomplete guidance for handling hardware failures during tests
- Need examples of device state verification in test scenarios
- Hardware resource lifecycle not fully defined
- Device state transition validation incomplete
- Missing hardware error recovery procedures
- No clear hardware resource ownership

## 7. Performance Monitoring Issues
- Missing examples of performance degradation detection
- No threshold definitions for resource usage monitoring
- Incomplete metrics collection for long-running tests
- Need guidance for performance impact during concurrent operations
- Performance baseline establishment unclear
- Resource usage thresholds not standardized
- Missing performance impact analysis
- No clear performance regression detection

## 8. Channel Synchronization Issues
- Missing examples of multi-channel error recovery
- Incomplete guidance for channel-specific resource limits
- Need examples of channel state verification in tests
- Lack of channel synchronization failure handling
- Channel state corruption detection missing
- No clear channel ownership model
- Missing channel resource isolation
- Incomplete channel cleanup procedures
