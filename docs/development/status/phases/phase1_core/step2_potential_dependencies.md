# Potential Circular Dependencies Analysis

## 1. Test Infrastructure Dependencies
- ResourcePool → TestDataManager (test resources)
- MonitoringCoordinator → TestExecution (metrics)
- HardwareResourceManager → TestEnvironment (devices)

## 2. Testing Infrastructure Dependencies
- TestingCoordinator → MonitoringCoordinator (test metrics/monitoring)
- TestingCoordinator → ComponentCoordinator (test state management)
- TestingCoordinator → CleanupCoordinator (test resource cleanup)
- TestingCoordinator → ResourcePool (test resource allocation)
- TestingCoordinator → TestEnvironment (test setup/teardown)
- TestingCoordinator → TestDataManager (test data handling)
- TestingCoordinator → TestMetrics (metrics collection)

## 3. Cleanup Dependencies
- CleanupCoordinator → StateMachine (cleanup states)
- CleanupCoordinator → MonitoringCoordinator (cleanup metrics)
- CleanupCoordinator → ComponentCoordinator (component cleanup)

## 4. Processing Chain Dependencies
- SignalProcessor → Transcriber (processing chain)
- AudioCapture → WASAPIMonitor (device management)
- SpeakerIsolation → WhisperTranscriber (speaker profiles)

## 5. Resource Management Dependencies
- ResourcePool → BufferManager (resource allocation)
- ResourcePool → StorageManager (buffer management)
- ResourcePool → ComponentCoordinator (component resources)

## 6. State Management Dependencies
- MonitoringCoordinator → StateMachine (state metrics)
- TestingCoordinator → ComponentState (test states)
- CleanupCoordinator → RecoveryLogger (recovery states)

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. Test Infrastructure Integration
   - Complex dependency chain in TestingCoordinator
   - Potential for circular dependencies during test execution
   - Resource management complexity during tests
   - State management across test boundaries

2. Resource Management
   - Multiple components depending on ResourcePool
   - Complex resource lifecycle management
   - Potential for deadlocks in cleanup procedures
   - Memory management across components

3. State Management
   - State transitions spanning multiple coordinators
   - Complex recovery state handling
   - Test state management complexity
   - State consistency during cleanup

### Mitigation Planning
1. Test Infrastructure
   - Clear interface boundaries for test components
   - Isolated test resource management
   - Independent test state tracking
   - Dedicated test cleanup procedures

2. Resource Management
   - Centralized resource allocation strategy
   - Clear resource ownership model
   - Standardized cleanup procedures
   - Resource isolation mechanisms

3. State Management
   - State transition validation
   - Recovery state coordination
   - Test state isolation
   - Cleanup state verification
