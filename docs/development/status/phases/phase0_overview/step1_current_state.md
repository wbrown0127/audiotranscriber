# Current State Overview (2025-02-20)

This document provides a high-level overview of the current system state and serves as the foundation (Step 0) for the coordinator architecture refactoring effort.

## System Health Overview
✓ **Core System**: Stable
🟡 **Test Framework**: Architecture Analysis Complete
🟡 **GUI Development**: 60% Complete
⚠️ **Deployment**: MSIX Pending

## Current Metrics
| Metric | Status | Target | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Latency | <30ms | <50ms | ✓ Exceeding target |
| Memory | 2GB | 4GB | ✓ 40% reduction achieved |
| CPU Usage | <80% | <80% | ✓ Within limits |
| Test Coverage | 63.9% | 90% | 🟡 Architecture review in progress |

## Recent Changes (2025-02-18/20)

### Architecture Foundations
- **Lock Hierarchy**: Established ordering (state → metrics → perf → component → update)
- **State Management**: Implemented channel-specific states with rollback mechanisms
- **Resource Management**: Activated tier-aware buffer optimization with ResourcePool integration

### Interface Development
- Created new interfaces directory with base interface files
- Implemented validation methods for interface compliance
- Added performance monitoring hooks and test isolation mechanisms

### Documentation Structure
- Split architecture documentation into logical phases (0-4)
- Created comprehensive documentation for dependencies, issues, and implementation plans
- Added visualization tools for component relationships

## Immediate Priorities
1. **Interface Implementation**
   - Implement core interfaces defined in phase3_implementation
   - Update existing coordinators to use new interfaces

2. **Component Decoupling**
   - Address identified circular dependencies
   - Continue component analysis based on phase1_core findings

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add interface-based tests following phase4_testing strategy
   - Enhance test coverage with real device testing

## Next Steps
Proceed to the next documents in this phase for detailed analysis of core architecture issues, proposed solutions, and implementation planning:

1. **step2_core_issues.md**: Comprehensive analysis of architectural issues including circular dependencies
2. **step3_solutions.md**: Detailed solutions to address the identified issues
3. **step4_transition_plan.md**: Timeline, milestones, and backward compatibility strategy
4. **step5_risk_assessment.md**: Critical risks, technical challenges, and contingency plans
5. **step6_metrics_validation.md**: Success metrics, acceptance criteria, and validation methodology
6. **step7_additional_considerations.md**: External dependencies, deployment, developer experience, security, and scalability
7. **step8_implementation_recommendations.md**: Detailed breakdown of implementation recommendations and changes
8. **file_naming_standardization.md**: Comprehensive plan to standardize file naming conventions
