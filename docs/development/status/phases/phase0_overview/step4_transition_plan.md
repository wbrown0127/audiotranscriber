# Transition Plan

## Timeline and Milestones

| Phase | Timeframe | Key Milestones |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Security & Compliance | 1 week | Security audit complete, compliance requirements defined |
| Interface Definition | 2 weeks | Core interfaces defined, validation tools created |
| Coordinator Refactoring | 3 weeks | Updated coordinators, dependency injection implemented |
| System Integration | 2 weeks | Component initialization chain updated, behavior verified |
| Validation | 1 week | Interface compliance verified, performance validated |
| Deployment & Developer Experience | 2 weeks | MSIX packaging complete, developer tools created |
| Performance Optimization | 1 week | High-load scenarios optimized, monitoring established |

## Stability Maintenance

- **Parallel Implementation**: Maintain existing architecture while developing new components
- **Feature Freeze**: Limit new feature development during critical transition phases
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each component individually before system-wide integration
- **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to revert to previous architecture if critical issues arise
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuous security scanning during transition
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor performance metrics throughout changes
- **Compatibility Verification**: Regular checks for PySide6, Whisper API, and Python compatibility
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track resource usage patterns during transition

## Backward Compatibility

Note: As specified in the task, backward compatibility is not a concern for this implementation.

## Release Strategy

- **MSIX Packaging**: Prepare Windows Store distribution package
- **Release Channels**: 
  - Development: Daily builds with latest changes
  - Beta: Weekly releases for testing
  - Stable: Monthly validated releases
- **Update Mechanism**: Automated update checks and installation
- **Version Control**: 
  - Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
  - Clear changelog maintenance
  - Release notes automation
