# Risk Assessment

## Critical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Circular dependencies reintroduced | High | Medium | Interface compliance validation, automated dependency checks |
| Performance degradation | High | Medium | Performance benchmarking at each phase, optimization sprints |
| Resource leaks during transition | Medium | High | Enhanced monitoring, automated leak detection |
| Test framework incompatibility | Medium | Medium | Incremental test framework updates, compatibility layer |
| Interface design flaws | High | Low | Early prototype validation, design reviews |
| External dependency conflicts | High | Medium | Version compatibility matrix, automated checks |
| Security vulnerabilities | Critical | Low | Regular security audits, vulnerability scanning |
| MSIX packaging issues | High | Medium | Early packaging tests, Windows Store validation |
| Hardware test lab gaps | Medium | High | Comprehensive device inventory, test coverage analysis |

## Technical Challenges

- **Lock Hierarchy Complexity**: Validate lock ordering in all refactored components
- **Async Operation Coordination**: Test all async paths with extended timeouts
- **Resource Cleanup Verification**: Implement enhanced verification for all cleanup paths
- **State Transition Validation**: Verify all state transitions during component integration
- **Interface Boundary Performance**: Monitor cross-interface call performance impact
- **Version Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with PySide6, Whisper API, Python 3.11-3.13
- **Resource Isolation**: Implement proper isolation between components and channels
- **Security Boundaries**: Validate security at interface boundaries
- **Update Mechanism**: Implement reliable in-app updates with rollback
- **Hardware Testing**: Manage diverse hardware configurations and test scenarios

## Contingency Plans

- **Critical Issue Response**: Dedicated team for rapid response to transition issues
- **Phased Rollback**: Ability to roll back individual components if issues arise
- **Hybrid Operation**: Support mixed old/new architecture if full transition delayed
- **Scope Reduction**: Identify optional features that can be deferred if necessary
- **Extended Validation**: Additional validation phase if quality metrics not met
- **Security Response**: Rapid response plan for security vulnerabilities
- **Release Channel Fallback**: Ability to revert to previous release channel
- **Hardware Fallback**: Minimum viable hardware configuration options
- **Performance Degradation**: Scalability reduction options for performance issues
- **Resource Constraints**: Resource limit adjustments for different scenarios
