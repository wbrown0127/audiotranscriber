# Foundation Phase (Weeks 1-2)

## Completeness Assessment (2025-02-24)

### Documentation Metrics
| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Interface Cohesion | 90% | Strong patterns, consistent methods |
| Documentation Quality | 85% | Detailed but missing versioning |
| Implementation Guidelines | 80% | Needs more examples |
| Performance Requirements | 75% | Some targets need review |
| Error Handling | 70% | Needs standardization |
| Testing Coverage | 65% | Needs detailed strategies |

### Identified Gaps
1. Interface Management
   - Version control mechanism undefined
   - Update/migration strategy missing
   - Extension patterns not documented
   - Error code standardization needed

2. Technical Concerns
   - Performance requirements need adjustment:
     * Monitoring overhead (5ms too aggressive)
     * Lock acquisition timing (5ms unrealistic)
     * Thread pool size (20 may be insufficient)
     * Component memory limits (500KB too restrictive)

3. Implementation Details
   - Interface examples needed
   - Testing strategies incomplete
   - Compatibility verification undefined
   - Performance testing methodology missing

        implementation: Any
    ) -> ValidationResult:
        pass
```

        self,
        component: str,
        metrics: Dict[str, float]
    ) -> ValidationResult:
        pass
