# Core Interface Definitions

This directory contains the foundational interface definitions that establish the core architecture of the system. These interfaces define the contracts between components and ensure proper decoupling.

## Interface Categories

### Version Control
- All interfaces follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Breaking changes require MAJOR version increment
- Backward compatibility maintained within MAJOR versions
- Version history tracked in interface documentation

### External Compatibility
- PySide6: Interface adaptations for API changes
- Whisper API: Version-specific interface implementations
- Python 3.11-3.13: Language feature compatibility
- Windows API: Audio subsystem interface requirements

### State Management
- [state_manager.md](state_manager.md): Core interface for managing component states, transitions, and history

### Resource Management
- resource_manager.md: Core interface for managing system resources and cleanup
- thread_manager.md: Core interface for managing thread lifecycles and coordination
- component_manager.md: Core interface for managing component lifecycles

### System Management
- monitoring_manager.md: Core interface for system monitoring and metrics
- test_manager.md: Core interface for test execution and validation
- cleanup_manager.md: Core interface for coordinated cleanup operations

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Interface Design
   - Clear method signatures
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Error handling patterns
   - Performance requirements
   - Security boundary validation
   - Hardware test lab specifications
   - Channel-specific requirements
   - Resource isolation patterns

2. Dependency Management
   - No circular dependencies
   - Clear ownership boundaries
   - Explicit dependencies
   - Interface segregation

3. Thread Safety
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Lock hierarchy compliance
   - Resource protection
   - State consistency

4. Performance
   - Response time targets
   - Resource usage limits
   - Monitoring hooks
   - Validation points

## Usage Notes

1. All interfaces must:
   - Follow naming convention with "I" prefix
   - Include complete documentation
   - Specify performance requirements
   - Define error handling

2. Implementation classes:
   - Located in core_systems/implementations/
   - Follow interface contracts exactly
   - Include all required validations
   - Meet performance targets

3. Testing:
   - Interface compliance tests in stabilization/testing/
   - Performance validation suites
   - Error handling verification
   - State transition testing

## Validation Requirements

1. Interface Compliance
   - Method signatures match
   - Documentation complete
   - Error handling implemented
   - Performance verified
   - Security boundaries validated
   - Hardware compatibility verified
   - Version compatibility checked
   - Resource isolation confirmed

2. Implementation Quality
   - No circular dependencies
   - Thread safety verified
   - Resource management correct
   - State consistency maintained

3. Testing Coverage
   - All methods tested
   - Error cases covered
   - Performance validated
   - Integration verified
