   - Test isolation missing

2. State Management
   - Complex state transitions across multiple types
   - No clear state ownership
   - Mixed state and resource management
   - Test state integration missing
   - Performance impact

3. Error Handling
   - Multi-level error tracking
   - Complex recovery paths
   - Mixed error types
   - Test integration missing
   - Error metrics incomplete

### Planned Improvements
1. Interface-based Decoupling
   - IMonitoringManager interface

- ResourcePool for test resources
- CleanupCoordinator for test cleanup

### Key Issues
1. Test Environment Management
   - Complex setup/teardown procedures
   - Real component interaction validation
   - Resource cleanup coordination
   - Test result organization
   - Performance analysis

2. Resource Management
   - Test resource isolation
   - Resource cleanup verification
   - Performance impact tracking
   - Memory management
   - Lock coordination

3. State Management
   - Test state tracking
   - Component state validation
   - Lock state verification
   - Thread health monitoring
   - Error state handling

### Planned Improvements
1. Interface-based Decoupling
   - ITestManager interface

   - ITestExecution interface
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. Resource Management
   - Dedicated test resource pools
   - Isolated test queues
   - Resource limit enforcement
   - Lock timeout configuration

## 4. Cleanup Coordinator

### Current Dependencies
- Direct dependency on StateMachine
- Maps cleanup phases to recovery states
- Complex state transition validation
- Requires monitoring coordinator

### Key Issues
1. State Integration
   - Tightly coupled phase/state mapping
   - Complex state transition validation
   - Mixed cleanup and state management
   - Performance impact

2. Cleanup Management
   - Ordered cleanup with dependency tracking
   - Complex step validation
   - Async and sync operations
   - Resource cleanup coordination

3. Lock Management
   - Complex lock hierarchy
   - Lock ordering matches MonitoringCoordinator
   - Multiple critical sections
   - Potential deadlock scenarios

### Planned Improvements
1. Interface-based Decoupling
   - ICleanupManager interface
   - IStateManager interface
   - IResourceManager interface
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. Resource Management
   - Clear cleanup ownership
   - Standardized procedures
   - Resource verification
   - Test integration

## Common Themes Across Components

### 1. Dependency Management
- Heavy reliance on MonitoringCoordinator
- Complex initialization chains
- Circular dependencies
- Mixed responsibilities

### 2. Resource Management
- Complex allocation patterns
- Mixed resource types
- No clear ownership
- Test integration challenges

### 3. State Management
- Complex state transitions
- Mixed state types
- No clear ownership
- Performance impact

### 4. Error Handling
- Complex error paths
- Mixed error types
- Recovery procedures
- Test integration
