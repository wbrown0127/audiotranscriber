## ResultAnalyzer Component Analysis

### Interface Analysis
- Current Interface Pattern: Command-line and programmatic interfaces with optional coordinator integration
- Dependency Count: 7 (numpy, matplotlib, scipy, typing_extensions, json, logging, pathlib)
- Circular Dependencies: None detected
- State Management Pattern: Coordinator-based state updates with error handling
- Resource Management Pattern: Automatic resource cleanup with coordinator notification
- Async Operations: Cleanup method is async, other operations synchronous
- Error Handling Pattern: Comprehensive try-catch with logging and coordinator notification

### Resource Usage
- Memory Pattern: 
  - Scales with dataset size and analysis window
  - Batch processing of test reports

  - No real-time channel management needed
  - File-based data exchange instead of channels
  - Coordinator communication via method calls
- Async State Transitions:
  - Cleanup process runs asynchronously
  - State progression during cleanup:
    * cleanup_started → file_deletion → cleanup_complete
  - Coordinator notified of state changes
  - Error states handled asynchronously
