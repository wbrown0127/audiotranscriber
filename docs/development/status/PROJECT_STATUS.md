# Audio Transcriber Project Status Report

## Overview
This document outlines the long-term roadmap, architectural decisions, and technical debt of the Audio Transcriber project.

## 1. Technical Debt & Architecture Decisions

### Architecture Evolution
1. Component Dependencies (2025-02-20)
- Analysis: Identified circular dependencies between core coordinators
  * Issue: MonitoringCoordinator â†” ComponentCoordinator bidirectional dependency
  * Impact: Complex initialization, testing challenges
  * Plan: Create coordinator interfaces to decouple components
  * Future: Implement BaseCoordinator and ResourceCoordinator interfaces

2. Resource Management
- Decision: Implemented tiered ResourcePool (4KB/64KB/1MB)
  * Rationale: Optimize memory usage for different data sizes
  * Impact: 40% memory reduction achieved
  * Future: Consider dynamic tier sizing based on usage patterns

2. Component Coordination
- Decision: Centralized coordinator pattern
  * Rationale: Better lifecycle management and state tracking
  * Impact: Improved system stability and error recovery
  * Future: Consider event-driven architecture for better scaling

3. Audio Processing
- Decision: Migrated from WMF to audioop-lts
  * Rationale: Better stability and simpler architecture
  * Impact: Achieved <30ms latency target
  * Future: Evaluate hardware acceleration options

### Technical Debt
1. Circular Dependencies
- Current: Tightly coupled coordinator components
- Issues: Complex initialization, testing difficulties
- Plan: Implement coordinator interfaces and decouple components

2. Thread Safety
