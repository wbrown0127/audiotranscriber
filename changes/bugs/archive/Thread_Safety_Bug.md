# Thread Safety and State Management Issues

## Issue Summary
Multiple interconnected issues affecting state management, monitoring, and thread safety across components.

## Bug Details
### Description
Several critical issues affecting system stability and reliability have been resolved:

1. State Management & Monitoring Issues: âœ“ FIXED

- âœ“ Added channel-specific monitoring attributes
- âœ“ Fixed state transition validation
- âœ“ Fixed invalid state transitions between states
- âœ“ Added proper error handling and recovery

2. Buffer & Queue Management: âœ“ FIXED (see Buffer_Manager_Fix.md)
- âœ“ Simplified error handling with clear hierarchy
- âœ“ Proper lock ordering implemented
- âœ“ Atomic state updates with proper locking
- âœ“ Better exception logging and error propagation

3. Recovery & Cleanup System: âœ“ FIXED
- âœ“ Added proper cleanup step validation and execution
- âœ“ Fixed recovery logging path initialization
- âœ“ Added state dump creation with proper error handling
- âœ“ Fixed cleanup step dependencies and transitions
- âœ“ Added verification retries for cleanup operations

4. Audio Processing Chain:
- WASAPI stability issues with buffer handling
- Signal processing failures and memory management
- Channel separation and monitoring issues
- Stream recovery and reinitialization problems

### Environment
* OS: Windows 11
* Python: 3.13.1
* Components Affected:
  - MonitoringCoordinator
  - BufferManager
  - StateMachine
  - CleanupCoordinator
  - WASAPIMonitor
  - SignalProcessor
  - RecoveryLogger

### Root Causes
1. State Attribute Naming:
   - MonitoringState uses trailing underscores (e.g., capture_queue_size_)
   - BufferManager attempts updates without underscores
   - Causes "Unknown state attribute" warnings

2. Channel Monitoring:
   - BufferManager implements channel-specific monitoring
   - MonitoringState lacks corresponding attributes
   - Results in monitoring data loss

3. State Transitions:
   - Invalid transitions between states
   - Cleanup step dependencies not properly validated
   - Affects system recovery and stability

4. Test Framework:
   - Test expectations don't match implementation
   - Timeout issues in integration tests
   - Path initialization problems

## Impact Assessment
- Compatibility Impact: ðŸ”´ High - Affects core functionality
- Performance Impact: ðŸ”´ High - Memory leaks and CPU spikes
- Side Effects: System instability and data loss

## Affected Components
1. MonitoringCoordinator:
   ```python
   class MonitoringState:
       # Current
       capture_queue_size_: int = 0
       processing_queue_size_: int = 0
       storage_queue_size_: int = 0
       
       # Needs
       capture_queue_size: int = 0
       processing_queue_size: int = 0
       storage_queue_size: int = 0
       # Plus channel-specific attributes
   ```

2. BufferManager: âœ“ FIXED
   ```python
   # Implemented proper error handling and state updates
   with self._global_lock:
       try:
           queue = self._buffer_queues.get(component)
           if not queue:
               raise ValueError(f"Invalid component: {component}")
           
           # ... queue operations ...
           
           if self.coordinator:
               with self._state_lock:  # Proper lock ordering
                   self.coordinator.update_state(**{
                       f"{component}_queue_size": queue.qsize()
                   })
       except Exception as e:
           self.logger.exception("Error in buffer operation")
           if self.coordinator:
               self.coordinator.handle_error(e, "buffer_manager")
   ```

3. StateMachine:
   ```python
   # Current - Missing validation
   if new_state == RecoveryState.FAILED:
       self._current_state = new_state
       return True
       
   # Needs
   if new_state == RecoveryState.FAILED:
       old_state = self._current_state
       if self._validate_transition(old_state, new_state):
           self._current_state = new_state
           return True
   ```

4. CleanupCoordinator:
   ```python
   # Current - Incorrect cleanup order
   async def cleanup(self):
       await self.stop_capture()
       await self.flush_buffers()
       
   # Needs
   async def cleanup(self):
       if not await self.validate_state():
           return False
       await self.stop_capture()
       if not await self.verify_capture_stopped():
           return False
       await self.flush_buffers()
   ```

       current = coordinator.get_state()
       assert hasattr(current, 'capture_queue_size')
       assert hasattr(current, 'processing_queue_size')
       assert hasattr(current, 'storage_queue_size')
   ```

   ```python
   def verify_buffers():
       stats = buffer_manager.get_performance_stats()
       assert 'capture_queue_size_left' in stats
       assert 'capture_queue_size_right' in stats
   ```

3. Cleanup Verification:
