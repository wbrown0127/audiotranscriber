# Storage Performance Bug Fix

## Issue Description
- Storage manager was attempting invalid state transitions during buffer flushing
- MonitoringCoordinator lacked disk_usage tracking capability
- Caused warning messages and errors in logs:
  * "Unknown state attribute: disk_usage"
  * "Invalid transition: idle -> idle"
  * "Invalid transition: flushing_buffers -> flushing_buffers"

## Root Cause
1. MonitoringState class did not have disk_usage attribute
2. StorageManager attempted state transitions without checking current state
3. Frequent state changes between idle and flushing_buffers due to buffer management

## Solution
1. Added disk_usage attribute to MonitoringState
2. Added state check before transitions in StorageManager.flush_buffer()
3. Verified normal buffer management behavior:
   - Buffer flushing triggered by:
     * Buffer usage > 80% capacity
     * Time since last flush > 1 second
     * Disk queue length < 80% utilization

## Implementation
- File: src/audio_transcriber/monitoring_coordinator.py
  * Added disk_usage attribute to MonitoringState class
  * Type: float
  * Default: 0.0
  * Purpose: Track disk buffer usage percentage

- File: src/audio_transcriber/storage_manager.py
  * Added state check before FLUSHING_BUFFERS transition
  * Prevents invalid same-state transitions
  * Maintains proper state machine operation

## Testing
- Verified through log analysis
- No more "Unknown state attribute" warnings
- No more invalid state transition errors
- Normal buffer management operation confirmed

## Impact
- ðŸŸ¢ Minor - System stability improved
- No breaking changes
- Performance optimization achieved
- Better state management

## Debug Notes
- All state transitions now properly validated
- Buffer management operating within expected parameters
- No performance degradation observed
