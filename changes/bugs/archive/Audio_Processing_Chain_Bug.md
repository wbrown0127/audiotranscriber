## Implementation Plan
1. WASAPI Stability:
   ```python
   class WASAPIMonitor:
       def handle_device_change(self):
           # Need proper device validation
           # Add state synchronization
           # Implement recovery mechanism
           pass

       def monitor_session(self):
           # Add robust session tracking
           # Improve error detection
           # Implement fallback modes
           pass
   ```

2. Signal Processing:
   ```python
   class SignalProcessor:
       def process_buffer(self):
           # Add memory optimization
           # Implement proper queuing
           # Fix channel handling
           pass

       def handle_overflow(self):
           # Add protection mechanisms
           # Implement recovery
           # Track statistics
           pass
   ```

3. Stream Recovery:
   ```python
   class AudioCapture:
       async def reinitialize(self):
           # Validate current state
           # Proper cleanup sequence
           # Verify new state
           # Handle failures
           pass
   ```

## Validation Steps
1. WASAPI Testing:
   ```python
   def test_wasapi_stability():
       # Test device changes
       # Verify session monitoring
       # Check recovery mechanisms
       pass
   ```

2. Signal Processing:
   ```python
   def test_signal_processing():
       # Verify memory usage
       # Check processing accuracy
       # Test overflow handling
       pass
   ```

3. Stream Management:
   ```python
   def test_stream_recovery():
       # Verify recovery sequence
       # Check resource cleanup
       # Test state transitions
       pass
   ```

## Rollback Plan
1. WASAPI Integration:
   - Keep current device handling
   - Maintain session monitoring
   - Document fallback procedures

2. Signal Processing:
   - Preserve processing paths
   - Keep memory management
   - Document limitations

3. Stream Management:
   - Maintain recovery paths
   - Keep cleanup procedures
   - Document known issues
