#### Implementation
1. Alert Management:
   ```python
   # Implemented - Alert history and suppression
   @dataclass
   class AlertHistory:
       alerts: list[Alert] = field(default_factory=list)
       max_size: int = 100
       
       def should_suppress(self, source: str, level: int) -> bool:
           recent = self.get_recent(minutes=1)
           similar = [a for a in recent if a.source == source and a.level == level]
           return len(similar) >= 3  # Suppress if 3+ similar alerts in last minute
   ```

2. Dynamic Thresholds:
   ```python
   # Implemented - Statistical threshold adjustment
   def get_dynamic_threshold(self, metric: str) -> float:
       history = self.threshold_history[metric]
       if not history:
           return getattr(self, f"{metric}_threshold")
           
       mean = sum(history) / len(history)
       std_dev = (sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in history) / len(history)) ** 0.5
       
       return min(getattr(self, f"{metric}_threshold"), mean + 2 * std_dev)
   ```

3. Thread Safety:
   ```python
   # Implemented - Enhanced thread management
   async def cleanup(self):
       try:
           with self._cleanup_lock:
               threads = list(self._registered_threads)
               for thread in threads:
                   try:
                       with self._thread_lock:
                           if thread in self._registered_threads:
                               if self.coordinator:
                                   self.coordinator.unregister_thread()
                               self._registered_threads.remove(thread)
                   except Exception as e:
                       logger.error(f"Error unregistering thread {thread.name}: {e}")
               
               self._alert_history = AlertHistory()
               self._last_emit.clear()
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Error during cleanup: {e}")
           raise
   ```

4. Resource Monitoring:
   ```python
   # Implemented - Efficient monitoring with dynamic intervals
   async def monitor_resources(self):
       while True:
           try:
               alerts = await asyncio.gather(
                   self.check_cpu_usage(),
                   self.check_memory_usage(),
                   self.check_storage_latency(),
                   self.check_buffer_usage(),
                   return_exceptions=True
               )
               
               # Dynamic sleep interval based on alert history
               if self._alert_history.get_recent(minutes=1):
                   await asyncio.sleep(self.config.check_interval / 2)
               else:
                   await asyncio.sleep(self.config.check_interval)
           except Exception as e:
               logger.error(f"Monitoring error: {e}")
               await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Back off on error
   ```

       # Test storage latency
       alert = await system.check_storage_latency()
       assert not alert.triggered  # Should use tempfile properly
       
       # Test dynamic intervals
       alerts = []
       for _ in range(10):
           alert = await system.check_cpu_usage()
           alerts.append(alert)

       system.alert_triggered.connect(
           lambda t, m, l: alerts.append((t, m, l))
       )
       
       # Generate multiple alerts
       for _ in range(5):
           system._emit_alert("Test", "Message", 2, "test")
           
       # Should be aggregated

           threads.append(thread)
           thread.start()
           
       for thread in threads:
           thread.join()
           
       assert len(system._registered_threads) == 10
   ```
