# Bug Fix Template

## Issue Summary
WASAPI Implementation Stability - pyaudiowpatch integration and stream reliability

## Bug Details
### Description
Replacement of WASAPI-Devices 0.5.0 with pyaudiowpatch requires additional stability monitoring and automatic recovery mechanisms for audio stream interruptions.

### Environment
* OS Version: Windows 11
* Hardware: Realtek sound card + VB-Cable
* Software: Python 3.13.1, pyaudiowpatch
* Dependencies: numpy, threading

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Initialize WASAPI loopback capture
2. Monitor for stream interruptions
3. Check for channel isolation issues
4. Verify stream recovery after system events

### 2025-02-03 21:33 - Real Device Testing & Validation Fixes
1. Device Validation Improvements:
   - Fixed loopback device detection and validation
   - Added proper handling of non-stereo devices
   - Improved device selection in AdaptiveAudioCapture
   - Enhanced stereo validation for loopback devices

2. Test Infrastructure:
   - Replaced all mock-based tests with real device tests
   - Added system audio loopback testing
   - Added VB-Cable device testing
   - Added concurrent device capture testing
   - Added buffer handling verification

3. Issues Resolved:
   ```
   test_device_change_detection: ‚úì FIXED
   - Using real device change events
   - Improved detection timing with real hardware

   test_audio_session_monitoring: ‚úì FIXED
   - Using real audio sessions
   - Proper device name handling

   test_recovery_mechanism: ‚úì FIXED
   - Recovery attempts properly tracked
   - State management improved

   test_adaptive_performance: ‚úì FIXED
   - Device validation working correctly
   - Proper handling of loopback devices
   ```

4. Status Update:
   - ‚úÖ All tests passing with real devices
   - ‚úÖ Device validation working correctly
   - ‚úÖ Recovery tracking fixed
   - ‚úÖ Testing infrastructure stable

### 2025-02-03 20:41 - Test Infrastructure Improvements
1. Added Test Timeouts:
   - Implemented Windows-compatible test timeouts using threading
   - Added timeouts to long-running tests:
     * Session monitoring: 3s timeout
     * Device change detection: 3s timeout
     * Recovery mechanism: 5m timeout
     * Adaptive performance: 10s timeout
     * Thread safety: 30s timeout

2. Monitoring Thread Improvements:
   - Added proper thread cleanup in WASAPIMonitor
   - Fixed monitoring flag initialization
   - Added timeout to thread joining
   - Enhanced thread state management

3. Current Issues:
   ```
   test_device_change_detection: TimeoutError after 3s
   - Device change events not triggering fast enough
   - Mock device list updates need improvement

   test_audio_session_monitoring: AssertionError
   - Mock device name access inconsistent
   - Session tracking needs better mock support

   test_recovery_mechanism: AssertionError
   - Recovery attempts not being counted
   - State management during recovery needs improvement

   test_adaptive_performance: AssertionError
   - Device validation failing
   - Need to handle non-stereo devices better
   ```

4. Next Steps:
   - Fix mock device list updates for faster change detection
   - Improve mock device name access in session monitoring
   - Enhance recovery attempt tracking
   - Add better device validation for adaptive performance

5. Current Status:
   - ‚úÖ Added test timeouts
   - ‚úÖ Improved thread cleanup
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Mock improvements needed
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Recovery tracking needs fix
   - üîÑ Testing infrastructure stable
