### Root Causes
1. State Management:
   ```python
   # Current - Uncoordinated state changes
   class Component:
       def change_state(self, new_state):
           self.state = new_state
           
   # Needs
   class Component:
       def change_state(self, new_state):
           with self.coordinator.state_lock:
               old_state = self.state
               if self.coordinator.validate_transition(old_state, new_state):
                   self.state = new_state
                   self.coordinator.notify_state_change(self, old_state, new_state)
   ```

2. Resource Management:
   ```python
   # Current - Independent resource management
   class Component:
       def __init__(self):
           self.resources = {}
           
   # Needs
   class Component:
       def __init__(self, resource_manager):
           self.resource_manager = resource_manager
           self.resource_id = resource_manager.register(self)
           
       def allocate(self, resource_type, amount):
           return self.resource_manager.allocate(
               self.resource_id, resource_type, amount
           )
   ```

3. Error Handling:
   ```python
   # Current - Local error handling
   try:
       self.process()
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
       
   # Needs
   try:
       self.process()
   except Exception as e:
       self.coordinator.handle_error(
           component=self,
           error=e,
           severity=ErrorSeverity.HIGH,
           requires_recovery=True
       )
   ```

4. Configuration:
   ```python
   # Current - Independent configuration
   def configure(self, **kwargs):
       self.config.update(kwargs)
       
   # Needs
   def configure(self, config: ComponentConfig):
       if not self.coordinator.validate_config(self, config):
           raise InvalidConfigError(f"Invalid config for {self}")
       self.config = config
       self.coordinator.notify_config_change(self)
   ```

       # Test concurrent transitions
       with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
           futures = [
               executor.submit(component.change_state, "new_state")
               for component in components

   def validate_resource_management():
       manager = ResourceManager()
       components = create_test_components(manager)

       for component in components:
           allocation = manager.get_allocation(component.resource_id)
           assert allocation.within_limits()
           
       # Verify cleanup
       for component in components:
           component.cleanup()
           assert manager.is_cleaned_up(component.resource_id)
   ```

3. Integration:

       # Verify component initialization
       assert all(
           component.is_initialized()
           for component in system.components
       )
       
       # Verify error propagation
       with pytest.raises(SystemError):
           system.simulate_error()
           
       # Verify recovery
       assert system.recover()
       assert system.is_healthy()
   ```

### Rollback Plan

   - Keep old state handling
   - Add state validation gradually
   - Maintain compatibility layer
   - Add rollback support

2. Resource Management:
   - Phase in resource manager
   - Add monitoring first
   - Implement limits gradually
   - Keep local fallbacks

3. Integration:
   - Maintain component independence
   - Add coordination gradually
   - Keep error isolation
   - Add feature flags

4. Configuration:
   - Keep current config system
   - Add validation gradually
   - Maintain backwards compatibility
